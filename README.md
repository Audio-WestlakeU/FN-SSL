# Full-band and Narrow-band fusion Network for SSL

![](https://markdown.liuchengtu.com/work/uploads/upload_428e0c0d47c467f17821fd116edbc41f.png)

## Introduction
This repository provides methods which  based on full-band and narrow-band fusion network  for sound source localization. The narrow-band module processes the along-time sequences to focus on learning these narrow-band spatial information. The full-band module processes the along-frequency sequence
to focus on learning the full-band correlation of spatial cues, such as the linear relation of DP-IPD to frequency.
## Methods
Two official implemented sound source localization methods are included:
*  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19610.pdf" target="_blank"> "FN-SSL: Full-Band and Narrow-Band Fusion for Sound Source Localization" </a>, INTERSPEECH, 2023. 
*   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07021" target="_blank"> "IPDnet: A Universal Direct-Path IPD Estimation Network for Sound Source Localization" </a> 
## Datasets
+ **Source signals**: from <a href="http://www.openslr.org/12/" target="_blank">LibriSpeech database</a> 
+ **Real-world multi-channel microphone signals**: from <a href="https://www.locata.lms.tf.fau.de/datasets/" target="_blank">LOCATA database</a> 
  
## Quick start (will be update soon)
+ **Preparation** 

    * Download the required dataset and organize the data according to the data_org in the data folder.

    * Generate multi-channel data, You can set **data_num (in Simu.py)** to control the size of the dataset. --train, -- test, --dev are used to control the generation of train dataset, test dataset, and validation dataset, respectively. The source data path of them are specified by **dirs ['sousig_train ']** in Opt.py.
    ```
    python Simu.py --train/--test/--dev
    ```
    * For DP-IPD regression, set **is_doa = False** (Model.FN_SSL), and use mse loss function, for DOA classification, set **is_doa = True** (Model.FN_SSL), and use ce loss function,  meanwhile, the predgt2doa needs to be replaced synchronously. The initial Learning rate of doa classification is set to 5e-4.
    ```
    net = at_model.FN_SSL(is_doa=True/False)
    ```
+ **Training**
    * For train step, --gpu-id is used to specify the gpu, ---bz corresponds to the batch size of train process, validation process, and test process, respectively.
    ```
    python Train.py --train --gpu-id [*] --bz * * * 
    ```
+ **Evaluation** 

    * In the inference stage, you can set **checkpoints_dir** (Predict. py) to select weights, we provide simulation dataset inference and locata dataset inference.
    * For simulated data evaluation
    ```
    python Predict.py --test --datasetMode simulate --bz * * *
    ```
    * For LOCATA dataset evaluation
    ```
    python Predict.py --test --datasetMode locata
    ```
+ **Pytorch Lightning version**

    * We have re implemented FN-SSL using the Pytorch-lightning framework, which has a improvement in training speed compared to the torch.
    * For Train,

    ```
    python main.py fit --data.batch_size=[*,*] --trainer.devices=*,*
    ```
    * For test,

    ```
    python main.py test  --ckpt_path logs/MyModel/version_x/checkpoints/**.ckpt --trainer.devices=*,*
    ```

+ **Pretrained models**

    * Using the FN_lightning model to load the lightning checkpoint in torch framework.

more checkpoints will be update soon.
